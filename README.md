This is the github repositry for the paper **Enhancing Cross Domain Protein and Peptide Interaction with Re trained Deep Learning Models**

*This paper proposes the idea of using Short Proteins Only for training Protein/Peptide Interaction Prediction Deep Learning models, which avoids noise in long sequences (where most of the sequences do not contribute to the learning of interaction); finally achieving enhanced performance & efficiency.*
